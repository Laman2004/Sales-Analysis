### Project Preview

This project presents a **Sales Analysis Dashboard** aimed at the comprehensive evaluation of organizational sales performance between 2010 and 2013. The dashboard incorporates interactive visualizations to reflect key performance indicators (KPIs), including:

- **Sales Year-To-Date (YTD)**: 680,000 USD  
- **Total Profit**: 20,000 USD  
- **Profit Margin**: 2%  
- **Average Purchase Value**: 1,500 USD

Product segmentation is applied across three categories: **Furniture**, **Office Supplies**, and **Technology**, enabling multidimensional data exploration. The dashboard further integrates bar and line charts to visualize temporal dynamics of sales and profit.

In addition, a dynamic table displays top-performing products by profit and revenue, enhancing product-level decision-making.

### Recommendations

1. **Profitability Optimization:**  
   The observed profit margin (2%) is significantly below optimal thresholds. A reevaluation of cost structures, discount strategies, and product pricing is recommended.

2. **Product-Level Analysis:**  
   A deeper statistical analysis of underperforming products should be conducted. Items with low profit-to-sales ratios may require strategic repositioning or discontinuation.

3. **Predictive Modeling:**  
   Integration of time-series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA or Prophet) would allow sales prediction and seasonality analysis for improved strategic planning.

4. **Enhanced Interactivity:**  
   Incorporating drill-down features and user-driven filtering (e.g., by region, sales manager, or customer segment) would increase analytical depth and user engagement.

### Problem Statement

In many mid-sized organizations, decision-makers lack real-time insights into product-level sales performance. Traditional reporting methods often fail to capture the evolving trends in sales and profitability across categories and time periods. This gap leads to inefficient resource allocation, missed revenue opportunities, and suboptimal inventory strategies.

### Methodology

The dashboard development followed an exploratory data analysis (EDA) approach:

1. **Data Preparation**: Sales data spanning 2010–2013 was cleaned and categorized.  
2. **Data Aggregation**: KPIs were calculated for year-to-date sales, profit, margin, and average purchase.  
3. **Visualization**: Interactive elements such as line charts, bar charts, and tables were used to enhance interpretability.  
4. **Category Filtering**: Data segmentation was implemented across three main product categories.

### Tools & Technologies Used

- **Microsoft Power BI**: For building the interactive dashboard  
- **Microsoft Excel**: Data preprocessing and structuring  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For custom measures and KPIs  
- **Data Source**: Sample sales dataset (2010–2013), cleaned and filtered manually

### Conclusion

The Sales Analysis Dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor trends, compare category-level performance, and identify top-performing products efficiently. By leveraging data visualization and basic analytics, the tool contributes to improved decision-making in sales strategy and resource planning. With additional enhancements such as forecasting and deeper segmentation, the dashboard can further support long-term strategic goals.
